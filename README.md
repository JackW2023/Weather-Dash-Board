# My Weather-App

<br/><br/>

## Description

My WeatherApp is a web application designed to provide real-time weather information and forecasts. It solves the problem of unpredictability in weather by providing current conditions and future forecasts. The development of this app enhanced my skills in API integration and JavaScript as well as markdown terms. I plan to come back to this project whenever I have time.
